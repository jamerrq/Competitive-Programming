All solutions here are accepted, the unsolved ones are putted in specified folders.

Most of the solutions are written in Java because it was the lenguage that I was using when I started.\
Now, I'm using Python.\
Most of the solutions are also a naive approach and sometimes I use a piece of DP and greedy strategies.\
I'm also in the way to learn new strategies and algorithms to improve my skills.
