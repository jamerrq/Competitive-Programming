All solutions here are accepted, the unsolved ones are put in specified folders.

Most of the solutions are written in Java because it was the language I was using when I started CP.\
Now, I'm using Python and barely C++.\
At the beggining the solutions were made from a naive approach while I was on my way to learn the bases.\
Since there, I have learned some estrategies as greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, DFS, BFS, etc.\
I'm also in the way to learn new strategies and algorithms to improve my skills.
